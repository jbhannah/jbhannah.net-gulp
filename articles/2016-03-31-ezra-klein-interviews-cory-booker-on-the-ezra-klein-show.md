An interview with a fascinating man who is definitely not your run-of-the-mill
politician.

If you're not listening to [The Ezra Klein Show][], you're missing out; he's
become one of the news media's best interviewers. I've been following his work
since his guest appearances on MSNBC in the "Countdown" era, and wasted no time
subscribing to this podcast when it was piloted and then launched. A great
interviewer never steals the spotlight from his guests, and Ezra does a
fantastic job of letting his guests express themselves without leading them on
or overwhelming them.

His [interview with Heritage Action for America CEO Michael Needham][] is an
excellent example of this. Even though Needham is objectively wrong about
Obamacare on a number of counts, Ezra is there to guide the conversation and let
the listeners draw their own conclusions from it, not to get bogged down in
arguments over who's right or wrong. The result is a unique insight into the
operations of the modern-day conservative political machine and the worldview
that drives it.
