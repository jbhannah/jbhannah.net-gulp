On May 2, I'll be joining the team formerly known as [Giftcard Zen][], now part
of RetailMeNot, as a Ruby on Rails and Angular.js software engineer. [It's][]
[no][] [secret][] that I've been doing Ruby and Rails development for a [long
time][] on my own, but this will be my first position as a full-time Rails
developer, and I couldn't be more excited[^php].

I have had an excellent year-plus at [Cyberitas Technologies][], and I'll
definitely miss it. If you are a developer of just about any sort in the Phoenix
area, I can't recommend the operation that Bruce and Scott have built there
highly enough. For me, though, ever since one of GCZ's developers messaged me on
LinkedIn to say he checked out [my podcast][] before contacting me, and then we
found out that just about every tool they use, I've already used for my own
projects, it's felt like a perfect fit. Jumping over to a startup (even a
recently acquired one) is always a risk, but it's one that it's the right time
for me to take, and one that plays to my strengths.



[^php]: Not just to [not be developing in PHP every day anymore][]. Although I
will admit, that's part of it.
