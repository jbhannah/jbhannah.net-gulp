An interview with a fascinating man who is definitely not your run-of-the-mill
politician.

> I've found divinity in places where people wouldn't normally see it. I've

Cory Booker very much mirrors my own optimistic view of politics and government
as a vehicle for good. He'll be in the White House one day.

Meanwhile, if you're not listening to [The Ezra Klein Show][], you're missing
out; he's become one of the news media's best interviewers in a very short time.
I've been following his work since his guest appearances on MSNBC in the
"Countdown" era, and wasted no time subscribing to this podcast when it was
piloted and then launched. A great interviewer never steals the spotlight from
his guests, and Ezra does a fantastic job of letting his guests express
themselves without leading them on or overwhelming them.

His [interview with Heritage Action for America CEO Michael Needham][] is an
excellent example of this. Even though Needham is objectively wrong about
Obamacare on a number of counts, Ezra is there to guide the conversation and let
the listeners draw their own conclusions from it, not to get bogged down in
arguments over who's right or wrong. The result is a unique insight into the
operations of the modern-day conservative political machine and the worldview
that drives it.
